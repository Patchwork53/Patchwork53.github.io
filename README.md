# About Me
I'm Sameen, a final year undergraduate student of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). My area of interest is Natural Language Processing but I dabble in Computer Vision as well. I'm a huge fan on open-source initiatives like huggingface, LLaMA, Mistral, Stable Diffusion etc. and hope to contribute to the OSS ML community.

Besides NLP, I like reading fiction. Kafka is my favorite and Nabokov, my guilty pleasure. I also like learning bits and pieces of various languages but hope to learn some to fluency if I ever have the time.
