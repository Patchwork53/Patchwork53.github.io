## Reading List
I'm currently reading into these topics. Reach out if you wana chat or collaborate.

+ In-Context Learning including In-Context Vectors and ICL as Kernel Regression.
+ Interpretable and non-interpretable adversarial Attacks such as AmpleGCG, AutoDAN 1 (Liu et al) and AutoDAN 2 (Ziu et al).
